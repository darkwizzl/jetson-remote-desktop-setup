# jetson-remote-desktop-setup
his guide is for setting up a Jetson when there’s no display and no onboard NIC available. It uses a USB‑C connection to open a serial terminal for first-time access, and Ethernet to provide network connectivity, solving the NIC issue. You’ll get the serial console over USB‑C, obtain an IP via Ethernet, then proceed with SSH/VNC for remote desktop access.
